## Developmental language disorders

Developmental language disorders (DLD) are diagnosed when children have difficulties with learning to use and understand language that cannot be explained by any obvious causal factor such as hearing impairment or intellectual disability. Children with DLD are at higher risk of developing social and emotional difficulties when compared to their typically developing classmates.

## Secondary data analysis

I am involved in two research projects that aim to reveal more about this poorly understood condition that affects around 7% of children in the U.K. Both projects involve secondary data analysis - this means that we work with large amounts of data that have already been collected by specialist government-funded research teams who are dedicated to this type of data collection. The advantage of this approach is that we have access to many more data-points than would be feasible if we were to attempt to collect the data in-house.
