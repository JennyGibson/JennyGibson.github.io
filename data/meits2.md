Our study will compare bilingual and monolingual children with autism, using established and novel cognitive, linguistic and social assessments. We want to determine whether the bilingual advantages found in typically-developing children are also found in the population with autism.

We also plan to do qualitative work in order to understand the choices multilingual families face. We will also work with schools to gain an educational perspective on the intersection of multilingualism and neurodevelopmental conditions.
