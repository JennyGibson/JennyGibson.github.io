## What is the HOPSCoTCh Project?
HOPSCoTCh stands for Hi-tech Observation of Play and Social Communication Trajectories in CHildren. It is a research project designed to help us understand more about children’s behaviour in school playgrounds. We use GPS technology to help us track children’s social and physical activity at playtime.
## What is so interesting about playtime?
Playtime is an opportunity for fun but it’s also an opportunity for learning. Children get chance to independently develop social skills such as making and developing friendships, following rules, sharing, competing and negotiating. It’s also a great opportunity for physical activity and improving wellbeing.
## How does it work?
 We attach GPS receivers and other movement sensors to customised baseball caps for children to wear on the playground. If you want to know more about GPS location there's an explainer for kids [here](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/gps/en/)
