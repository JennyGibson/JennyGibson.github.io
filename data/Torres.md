*Pablo is a Research Assistant for the ChiRRP project. He is taking a lead on coding our observational measure of pretence.*

Pablo is an educational and developmental psychologist specialising in primary school years. He is currently finishing a PhD in the Psychology & Education group at the Faculty of Education at Cambridge where he studied the relationship between culture, teacher-student interaction, and children's learning mindsets, as well as self-regulation. He has also been involved in researching the link between play and writing skills as part of the PLaNS project, and worked conducting studies about the assessment of teacher quality in Chilean schools at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

Pablo's research interest lies in understanding the relationship between social interactions, including play and pedagogical interactions, and children’s motivational mindsets, social, and cognitive development. Within the CHIRPP project, he is currently in charge of developing and testing a new comprehensive observational measure of social pretend play, which our PEDAL strand is examining in relation to its predictive validity of children’s linguistic and social development.
