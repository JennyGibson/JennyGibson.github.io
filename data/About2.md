I'm proud to be a principal investigator in the centre for research on the role of Play in Education, Development and Learning (PEDaL). In PEDaL I lead a team of researchers who are working on understanding the role of play in social and linguistic development. You can read more about specific projects on these webpages.

I also spend lots of time teaching on the Cambridge tripos (aka undergraduate degree) in [Education, Psychology and Learning](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/courses/undergrad/psychology/), as well as acting as co-ordinator for our MPhil/MEd programme in [Psychology & Education](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/courses/graduate/masters/themes/psyched/).

I believe in the potential of education as a truly democratising agent of change and a means of benefiting everyone in society.

> "I believe that education, therefore, is a process of living and not a preparation for future living."

*John Dewey, 1897*

## Play
I find (most) of my work to be playful - a research and teaching career certainly gives me lots of opportunities to explore, reflect, discover and to step out of my comfort zone.
When I'm not at work I enjoy reading, walking in green spaces and playing with my little dog Captain.
