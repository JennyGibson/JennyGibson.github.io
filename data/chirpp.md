## Investigating Children's Relationships with Peers through Play

The ChiRPP project is investigating how play could support children to develop the social skills needed to learn and flourish at school. Play is a difficult concept to pin down scientifically, so the project is aiming to establish a framework for measuring play that involves taking different perspectives into account including those of children, parents, teachers and researchers.

We are also measuring other aspects of child development relating to social skills (such as language and emotional understanding). By doing this we can establish whether or not play makes an independent contribution to social skills and school readiness.
