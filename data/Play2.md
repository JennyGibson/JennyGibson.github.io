However, although most people have an intuitive idea that they know play when they see it, it is a surprisingly difficult concept to pin down precisely.

For example, it seems uncontroversial to define play as being freely chosen and pleasurable, and yet the compulsive and sometimes stressful experience of needing to complete an [insanely hard platformer](http://www.oriblindforest.com/#!//) (or jigsaw puzzle if that's your thing) can feel like it meets neither of these criteria.

In fact, the more I think about play, the more I think the art that might best represent it is M. C. Escher's impossible buildings. Just when you think you've got a handle on how it works, you find a new angle that changes your perspective.
