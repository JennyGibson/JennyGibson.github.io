*Does having a definition of play really matter?*

On one level, perhaps not. If we accept play as a 'virtue' i.e. as a good thing in its own right, then if the definition varies somewhat between different people maybe it doesn't matter so much.

From a scientific perspective however, if we would like to test some of the claims that have been made for play as a key mechanism in child development then we need to be precise. For example, if rough and tumble play is thought to be a better way of developing physical literacy than indoor exercise classes I'd need to find ways of reliably measuring rough & tumble play, exercise and physical literacy in order to test out my predictions.

Moreover, as my fellow developmental scientists are a sceptical bunch on the whole, I'd need to demonstrate that I really had measured play and that someone else could repeat the measurement independently and be reasonably certain of getting a similar result.

## So how do you define play in your research?

We're working on it! As part of my work in the [PEDaL Centre](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/centres/pedal/), I'm leading a team of researchers who are aiming to establish a framework for thinking about play that lends itself to empirical studies in developmental psychology. You can find out more about this research [here]().
