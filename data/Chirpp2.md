The Chirpp study follows children over the first three years of primary school from Reception to Year 2. This enables researchers to test their predictions about how play may contribute to social development in the longer term. So far, over 200 children have taken part in the study.  Our preliminary findings from reception aged children indicate there is indeed a strong association between play and social skills; however we will need to use the follow up data to work out the nature of any causal relationships.
